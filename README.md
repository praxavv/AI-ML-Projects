# Combined `README.md` for `AI-ML-projects`

This repository serves as a centralized hub for a diverse range of my projects in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Projects

### AI Chess Bot
This project documents my first foray into reinforcement learning. It's a chess engine developed in Python, inspired by a tutorial series by Eddie Sharick. The project uses Python 3.7.8 and pygame 2.0.1.

**Key features include:**
* A functional chess engine.
* The ability to play against the computer or another local player.
* Basic game commands, such as undoing a move (`z`) and resetting the game (`r`).

**Future development ideas:**
* Implementing move ordering to optimize engine speed.
* Improving game-state evaluation, including king placement.
* Integrating a book of openings.

### Digit Recognition Neural Network
This project is a neural network model designed for digit recognition based on the MNIST dataset. The model predicts numbers from 0 to 9. Due to its computational requirements, it is best run on a platform like Google Colab. The script allows users to draw a number on a canvas, and the neural network will then predict the poorly drawn number.

### Accounts Payable/Receivable Reconciliation Automation
This project automates the process of accounts payable and receivable reconciliation, streamlining a common financial task. The repository contains the necessary scripts and instructions to clone and run the automation, assuming the required libraries are installed.

Happy coding!
