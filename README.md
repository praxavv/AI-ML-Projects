This repo is for most of my AI/ML projects.

1. auto_reconcile folder is an automation of accounts payable/receivable reconciliation. Clone and run it by installing necessary libraries.

2. Digit_Recognition.py is a Neural Network based on the MINST dataset. It predicts a number from 0-9. Use Google Colab to run the script as your local machine may not have enough computing power. Just run the script, Draw a number and the NN will predict your poorly drawn number.

Happy coding !
